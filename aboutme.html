				<h3>Who: Somanchi Harshini Vysali is a student currently pursuing her graduate degree in lifestyle accessory and product design department from NIFT, India (National Institute of Fashion Technology). She is very passionate about what she does and is very active in learning new things. She is quite social and a fun loving person.
				</h3>
				<!-- <h4>somanchi1796@gmail.com</h4> -->
				<h4>What: Most of her design work is product based and experimentation is her forte. Few of the several things that intrigue her are bold forms, lines, triangles and simple colors. She strongly believes in eco-friendly products.</h4>

				<h4>Why: The interest and inspiration in design has been developed for Vysali as a child watching her father, who himself is an interior designer. She grew up seeing his work and admiring the kind of work he does, this led her to pursue education in product designing and home decor.</h4>

				<h4>What Else: She is not all about design, she loves reading books and has been learning Carnatic vocal music since she was an eight year old. Lately besides modeling for some commercials, she has also discovered that she has talent in drama when she acted in a few 'web-series' as a protagonist.</h4>
